- when running with full speed into the right endwall, the Viking can be seen twice/overlapped for a short moment, as if it's frozen still in time
- you can jump in the air, in the area between first hill and the isle in the sky
- inertia is a bit too strong, but maybe that's bc I'm a shitty player :P
